## TO-DO
TODO: Oxide permissions, create a hook on successful upload. Complete README

## About 
This plug-in is a simple tool to allow players with the appropriate permission level the ability to upload the art of a sign they are looking at to Imgur. The plug-in may optionally be integrated with DiscordCore, to DM the player the Imgur link or post to a channel, and/or ServerRewards, to deduct a configurable amount of RP from the player's balance.
